#  WhichKey.Unity
a vim-like key sequence shortcut manager for unity inspired by whichkey.nvim.
# What is WhichKey and why
Instead of using modifiers key combination,WhichKey accept ``Active`` + key sequence,for example you assign ``Space`` as your active key:
- Unity : **Move To view** ``ctrl`` ``alt`` ``f`` **Align with view** ``ctrl`` ``shift`` ``f``
- WhichKey: **Move to View** ``space`` ``v`` ``m``  , **Align with View** ``space`` ``v`` ``a``
